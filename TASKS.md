# Implementation Plan — quantification v1

Derived from DESIGN.md rev 6. Tasks are grouped into waves: everything in a
wave has its dependencies satisfied by earlier waves only, so tasks within a
wave run **in parallel** (`∥`). Each task names its normative sections and
exit criteria. Gates M1–M4 are blocking milestones.

## Wave 0 — foundations (all four parallel)

- **W0.1 Workspace scaffold** — cargo workspace, `crates/{core,proto,server}`,
  CI skeleton (fmt, clippy, nextest, cargo-deny). Exit: `cargo build` green.
- **W0.2 Config & frozen constants** — all §7 parameters; option parsing,
  resolution, `options_echo` canonical serialization (§6.2). Exit: defaults
  pinned by unit tests.
- **W0.3 Golden corpus bootstrap** — §12 fixture list incl. single-line JSON
  dumps (stage 1b), `\u000A`-only newlines, duplicate/escaped structural
  keys, BOM, prior-marker payloads, stage-1b boundary cases. Grows forever.
- **W0.4 Fuzz scaffold** — cargo-fuzz targets stubbed for sniff / locator /
  splitter. Exit: one clean run each.

## Wave 0.5 — go/no-go spike (sequential, blocks Wave 1)

- **S1 Locator perf spike** (§8) — throwaway escape-aware scanner vs the
  400 MB/s floor on real escaped-heavy payloads.
  **Gate M1**: pass ⇒ continue; fail ⇒ redesign §4.1 before anything else.

## Wave 1 — core primitives (all six parallel; deps W0 + M1)

- **W1.1 Schema sniff + span locator** (§4.1) — eligibility map, degradation
  routing, depth/span caps, BOM skip, decoded-key matching, last-wins keys.
  Exit: locator fixtures green; hot loop allocation-free (asserted).
- **W1.2 Unit splitter** (§4.4 stages 1+1b) — line split; normative record
  segmentation `u_head`/`u_i`/`u_tail`; caps. Exit: property test — units +
  joiners reassemble to the original span byte-for-byte.
- **W1.3 WS-normalization transform** (§4.2) — escape-unit collapse, trim.
  Exit: golden vectors incl. mixed `\n` / `\u000A`.
- **W1.4 Hashing facade** — xxh3-128/64 fixed-seed wrappers; open-address
  fingerprint table, length→hash→memcmp order, hard caps (§4.4.2, §7).
- **W1.5 Mask automata** (§4.6) — six masks, priority order,
  leftmost-longest. Exit: golden mask vectors.
- **W1.6 Proto crate** (§6.2) — corrected .proto compiles; tonic codegen;
  shared types. Independent of core.

## Wave 2 — detectors & output (deps W1)

- **W2.1 Commit ledger + profitability gate** (§4.4) — removal rule (member
  union + joiners), anchor-offset emit ordering, stats counters. Deps:
  W1.2, W1.4. Defines the interface every detector commits through.
- **W2.2 Stage 3 exact runs** ∥ **W2.3 Stage 4 ws-runs** ∥
  **W2.4 Stage 5 repeated blocks** (ws-normalized domain) ∥
  **W2.5 Stage 6 template groups** — all after W2.1
  (W2.4 also needs W1.3; W2.5 also needs W1.5).
- **W2.6 Renderer / marker grammar** (§4.5) — exact pinned shapes + CCCC
  checksum. Parallel with W2.2–W2.5 (consumes commit ledger only).
- **W2.7 Splicer** (§4.5) — copy buffer + patch recorded ranges; buffer-
  reuse robustness hook for §12 poisoned-buffer test. Parallel with detectors.
- **W2.8 Stage 7 templated blocks** — after W2.4 + W2.5 (template-id scan,
  min period 1).
- **W2.9 Pipeline orchestration + Stats assembly** (§3, §4.5) — after
  W2.2–W2.8. **Gate M2**: chat golden outputs byte-stable ×1000.

## Wave 3 — API & transports (deps W2.9)

- **W3.1 Library API** — `crates/core` public surface, options resolution
  echo, `strict_validate` flag (§4.1). Sequential first.
- **W3.2 HTTP/axum** (§6.1) ∥ **W3.3 gRPC/tonic unary** (§6.2) ∥
  **W3.4 CCR store + Restore** (§9, flag-gated) — all parallel behind W3.1;
  W3.2 implements `X-Stats-*` naming verbatim.

## Wave 4 — verification & perf (overlaps Waves 2–3 where noted)

- **W4.1 Property tests** (§12) — R3 parse validity, splice exactness,
  idempotence, marker escape-safety, restore identity. After W2.9.
- **W4.2 Determinism CI gate** (§5) — 1000× PR / 200k nightly soak / fuzz
  double-run / CPU-feature matrix (baseline vs AVX2 vs NEON). After W2.9.
- **W4.3 Criterion benches + nightly perf gate** (§8 per-stage budgets);
  measure the 8 MiB splice copy explicitly. After W2.9. **Gate M3**:
  ≥100 MB/s p50 aggregate.
- **W4.4 Adversarial perf fixtures** (§12) — unique floods, giant line,
  periodic patterns, collision pressure, maximal-density `},{`. Parallel
  with W4.3.
- **W4.5 Continuous fuzzing** (§12) — live from W1 onward; triage weekly.
- **W4.6 Offline eval harness** (§12) — tokenizer-based success metric +
  task-quality parity suite. Parallel from W2.9 onward (external models
  needed); **Gate M4** non-blocking until corpus/task suite ratified (§13).

## Critical path

```
W0.1 → S1(M1) → W1.1 → W2.1 → W2.9(M2) → W3.x → W4.3(M3)
secondary pole: W1.5 → W2.5 → W2.8 → W2.9
```
